# Naive-Bayes-in-C-
C++ ML program
I would like anyone who sees this to tell me if they found it useful. Or ways you think I might be able to improve.
Also, no clue for best c++ practices to all those files are in the same .cpp 
So, any links to better formatting would be appreciated.

To run my program you will need to place the titanic_project.csv wherever you IDE pulls from. I also pretty thouroughly commented the functions so they are hopefully transparent.
